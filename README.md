## *What is SabaccðŸ¤“*
[Sabacc](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sabacc) is a short and simple card game that comes from Star Wars. Unlike many games in Star Wars, this game can actually be played and there are a few different versions of it. The version that I'm recreating is called [Corellian Spike](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corellian_Spike).

## *How do you play*
Before the game starts one player is selected to be the dealer.

#### Game setup
To start, the dealer sets up two different piles. The draw pile (face down), and the discard pile (face up). Then each player is given two random cards from the draw pile.

#### Gameplay
The aim of Sabacc is to get your cards closest to 0. There are positive cards, and negative cards. Your total score is the sum of the cards.

Every round players are given the chance to do one of three moves:
- **Draw** - Take a card from the top of the draw pile and add it to your hand. And optionally discard one of your cards to the discard pile
- **Swap** - Swap a card from your hand with the top card in the discard pile
- **Stand** - Do nothing

Every player dose one of the three moves listed above, then once the dealer has finished their turn they roll the two spike dice. If both faces match everyone places their cards face up on the discard pile and is given new cards equal to the amount of cards that they jut had.

After the dice has been rolled three times all players reveal their cards, and the player with the score closer to 0 wins.
